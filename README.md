# Face_Detection_Using_Python 
I used a pre-trained data model to detect the face, smile and eyes by using haarcascade .
I imported OpenCV to train the data .By using it, we can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.
The first task that we perform is detecting faces in the image(photograph) or video stream.
